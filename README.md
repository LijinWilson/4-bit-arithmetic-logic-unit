# 🚀 4-bit ALU Design (Verilog)

## 📝 **Overview**

This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using Verilog HDL. The ALU is a fundamental building block in any processor, capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit input operands.

---

## ⚡ **Features**

✅ Supports **8 operations**:

| Select | Operation   | Description            |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 000    | Addition    | Adds two 4-bit numbers |
| 001    | Subtraction | Subtracts b from a     |
| 010    | Bitwise AND | Performs a & b         |
| 011    | Bitwise OR  | Performs a \| b        |
| 100    | Bitwise XOR | Performs a ^ b         |
| 101    | Bitwise NOT | Performs \~a           |
| 110    | Transfer b  | Outputs b              |
| 111    | Transfer a  | Outputs a              |

✅ **Carry detection** for addition and subtraction
✅ **Zero flag** for result validation
✅ Fully synthesizable and test bench verified
✅ Structured and readable code for easy learning
